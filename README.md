## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Creating a toggle switch and gradient border need different approach which is a little far from classic css works. 
for flex boxes, I prevent to change flow-direction from column to row by trying to wrap automatically based on the available size on desktop and mobile

### Continued development

There are different ways of creating gradient single border with curve corner which would not need ::after/::before. Try to solve the problem with other solutions
